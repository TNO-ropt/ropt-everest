# `ropt-everest`

The `ropt-everest` plugin extends
[`ropt`](https://tno-ropt.github.io/ropt/latest/) with functionality specific to
Everest. It provides the ability to load custom Python code to override the
default optimization workflow. These custom workflows can either be run via the
standard Everest command line interface (cli), or via a script that bypasses the
Everest cli.
